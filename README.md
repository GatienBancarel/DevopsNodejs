### Architecture

Our project uses a main.ts file where we created our server and in wich we specified the routes of the project. We got 5 main routes : 
                                - home 
                                - signIn
                                - signUp
                                - signOut
                                - logged
                             

Each of these routes have a different purpose.
With the home route we can access the home page in which we can get to the signIn and the signUp page. These pages let the users sign in and sign up following his desires.
